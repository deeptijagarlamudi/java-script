NFR for reusable components
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) for a reusable UI component focus on the qualities that ensure the component is efficient, scalable, and user-friendly in various contexts. Here are some typical NFRs for a reusable UI component:

1. Performance
Responsiveness: The component should load and render quickly, with minimal delay, even under high load or when integrated into a large application.
Low Memory Usage: The component should not consume excessive resources, ensuring smooth performance in resource-constrained environments.
2. Scalability
Support for High Usage: The component should perform well when used in large datasets or multiple instances in a single view.
Adaptability: The component should be able to scale across different device types (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
3. Compatibility
Cross-Browser Compatibility: It should work correctly across all major browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Cross-Platform Compatibility: The component should function seamlessly on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Framework Agnostic: If needed, the component should not rely too heavily on a specific framework to allow reuse in different tech stacks (e.g., React, Angular, etc.).
4. Accessibility
WCAG Compliance: It should follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure it can be used by people with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen readers, etc.).
ARIA Support: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide rich accessibility for all users.
5. Security
Input Validation: It should properly handle and sanitize all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or injection attacks.
Secure Data Handling: Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed or mishandled by the component.
6. Usability
Intuitive Interaction: The component should provide an intuitive user experience and follow common UI patterns.
Customizability: It should be easy to modify or extend the appearance and behavior of the component through configuration or theming.
Error Handling: It should have clear, user-friendly error messages and graceful handling of unexpected behavior.
7. Maintainability
Modularity: The component should be developed with clean, modular code to make it easy to maintain, extend, and test.
Documentation: It should come with clear, comprehensive documentation that explains how to integrate, configure, and use the component.
8. Reusability
Configurable and Flexible: The component should allow easy configuration of different behaviors, states, and layouts so that it can be used in multiple contexts.
Versioning: Ensure backward compatibility and versioning to allow seamless upgrades in different projects.
9. Localization
Multilingual Support: The component should support multiple languages and handle various date, time, and currency formats for global use.
10. Testing
Test Coverage: The component should have automated unit, integration, and possibly UI tests to ensure reliability across different environments.
Resilience: It should gracefully handle edge cases and recover from failures without affecting the overall system.
Ensuring that these non-functional requirements are met will result in a robust, flexible, and high-quality reusable UI component.
